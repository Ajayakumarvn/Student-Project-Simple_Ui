            DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks pose a significant
            threat to online businesses and individuals alike. In a DDoS attack,
            multiple compromised computers flood a target server or network with
            an overwhelming amount of traffic, rendering it unable to handle
            legitimate requests. These attacks can disrupt services, cause
            financial losses, and damage the reputation of businesses or
            individuals.
