          <p>
            A WiFi intrusion/attack detection system is a vital component in
            securing wireless networks from unauthorized access, malicious
            activities, and potential security threats. By leveraging machine
            learning techniques, such as anomaly detection and pattern
            recognition, it becomes possible to detect and mitigate WiFi
            intrusions more effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            WiFi intrusion detection systems (IDS) monitor network traffic,
            analyze it in real-time, and identify any suspicious or malicious
            behavior. Machine learning algorithms are trained on a large dataset
            of normal network traffic to learn the patterns and characteristics
            of regular network behavior. Once the model is trained, it can
            identify deviations from the normal behavior and raise alerts when
            potential intrusions or attacks are detected.
